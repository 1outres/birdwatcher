1.11.3

* Move code to Alice-LG GitHub organization
* Include caching information alongside ttl
* Repair endpoint 'protocols'
* Documentation on interpretation of route count numbers
* Improve example configuration
* Caching of parsed responses from birdc.
  Eliminates an additional parser run for cache hits.
