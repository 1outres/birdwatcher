# birdwatcher

birdwatcher is a small HTTP server meant to provide an API defined by
Barry O'Donovan's
[birds-eye](https://github.com/inex/birds-eye-design/) to
[the BIRD routing daemon](http://bird.network.cz/).

In the background it (doesn't yet) runs the `birdc` client and sends
commands and parses the result.

Developed by Daniel and MC from [Netnod](https://www.netnod.se/) in
two days at the RIPE 73 IXP Tools Hackathon in Madrid, Spain.
